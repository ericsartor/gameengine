- cameras
- hitbox "groups" so that certain hitboxes can ignore each other
- stage metadata format/loading
- allow partial movement when a hitbox would be hit
- allow Pawns to have a position origin in pixels
    - hitbox calculations should consider this value
    - should treat as a negative offset for drawing
- figure out how to organize class methods that are only to be used by the engine separately from public methods to be used by the game logic
- dedupe pawn loading if multiple pawns are to use the same config

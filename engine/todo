- make the canvas something that can be placed in the page rather than taking over the body
- hitbox "groups" so that certain hitboxes can ignore each other
- look into why pawn cant get through 1 grid wide gap in hitboxes (stageTest)
- look into why pixels arent crisp (stageTest)
- allow partial movement when a hitbox would be hit
- allow Pawns to have a position origin in pixels
    - hitbox calculations should consider this value
    - should treat as a negative offset for drawing
- figure out how to organize class methods that are only to be used by the engine separately from public methods to be used by the game logic
- dedupe pawn loading if multiple pawns are to use the same config
- Pawn "animation sets", basically matched sets of animations with the same name but different sprites, that can be switched between
    - this would be for things like a "runing" vs "walking" animation set that would be toggled on press/release of "shift" for example
